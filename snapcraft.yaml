summary: Tasks, boards & notes for the command-line habitat
description: |
  By utilizing a simple and minimal usage syntax, that requires a flat learning curve, Taskline enables you
  to effectively manage your tasks and notes across multiple boards from within your terminal. All data are
  written atomically to the storage in order to prevent corruptions. At the moment there are two storage modules.
  Local storage where your task and are never shared with anyone or anything, or the firestore module, where your
  tasks are saved in your firestore database and can be shared across all your devices.
  Deleted items are automatically archived and can be inspected or restored at any moment.
